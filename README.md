# react-multiple-choice
React-multiple-choice is a super customizable library of components to easily add a multiple choice form to your application. Access to the individual components of the form gives you full control of what is rendered in your application.

# Installation and usage
The easiest way to use react-multiple-choice is to install it from npm and build it into your app with webpack.
`npm install react-multiple-choice`

React-multiple-choice gives you all of the components you need to build out your form. Let's dive into those components.

# Components
## Test
`import { Test } from react-multiple-choice`

The test component is a wrapper for your form, all other components must be wrapped in a Test.

#### Props

`onOptionSelect` - Function - A function that returns the an object containing the question number as the keys and the selected option's value as the value.
NOTE: If the user has not selected an option for a question, that question number will not appear in the return value of `onOptionSelect`
`Style` - Object

ex. `<Test onOptionSelect={selectedOptions => console.log(selectedOptions)} />`

## QuestionGroup
`import { QuestionGroup } from react-multiple-choice`

The QuestionGroup component is a wrapper for each individual question. It wraps the question and options.

#### Props
`questionNumber` - Integer - This will be the key provided by the `Test` component's `onOptionSelect` return value.
`Style` - Object

## Question
`import { Question } from react-multiple-choice`

The Question component is a just a wrapper to display the question.

#### Props
`Style` - Object

## Option
`import { Option } from react-multiple-choice`

The Option component is a wrapper for all of the options for each question.

#### Props
`Value` - string - This will be the value provided by the `Test` component's `onOptionSelect` return value.

`Style` - Object - This is the only style that is different from the others. This prop is a nested object containing an icon object and an option object. This allows you to style both the container of the option and the radio icon.
ex. 
```
<Option style={{
    icon: {
      color: "chartreuse"
    }, 
    option: {
      width: "100%"
    }
  }} />
```

# Example Usage
```
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { Test, QuestionGroup, Question, Option } from 'react-multiple choice';

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    selectedOptions: {}
  };
  render() {
    return (
        <Test onOptionSelect={selectedOptions => this.setState({ selectedOptions })}>
          <QuestionGroup questionNumber={0}>
            <Question>What's your favorite food?</Question>
            <Option value="0">Mac n Cheese</Option>
            <div>Add some additional info or tooltips for specific questions</div>
            <Option value="1">Steak</Option>
            <Option value="2">Sushi</Option>
            <Option value="3">Pad Thai</Option>
          </QuestionGroup>
        </Test>
    );
  }
}
render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```
